According to the specifications, there should be 1 or more Python scripts for each of these 4 categories: 

# 1. Log File Analysis

Should iterate through the lines of a pre-existing log file, find suspicious patterns, and generate a report with the findings.

# 2. System Performance Monitoring

Should periodically retrieve performance metrics of the computer, alerting if any flags (probably because a value is too high) are set off and logging performance metric data.

# 3. Alert Generation

Should actively monitor logs or performance metrics and alert remotely (email, dashboard, SMS, etc) to a system administrator if a flag is set off.

# 4. Automating Routine Security Checks

Should regularly run a scan for vulnerabilities and monitor network traffic.
